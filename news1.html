                                vaccines directly to Punjab, citing the company policy that it deals with the 
                                Government of India, not with any private party and state. Punjab's nodal officer 
                                for vaccination and senior IAS officer Vikas Garg on Monday said Pfizer in its 
                                communication to the state said, "Pfizer is working with federal governments 
                                across the world to supply its COVID-19 vaccine for use in national immunisation programmes.</p>

                                in the number of Covid tests done in the past 15 weeks in the country along with a steady dip in
                                the weekly positivity rate reported in the last two weeks. Talking about the effect of the pandemic
                                on children and young people, AIIMS, Delhi director Randeep Guleria noted, "Children suffered 
                                collateral damage due to mental stress, smartphone addiction and education challenges amid the ongoing pandemic."</p>

                                hospital care in November 2019, months before China disclosed the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                                the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing a previously undisclosed U.S. 
                                intelligence report.The newspaper said the report - which provides fresh details on
                                the number of researchers affected, the timing of their illnesses, and their hospital
                                visits - may add weight to calls for a broader probe of whether the COVID-19 virus
                                could have escaped from the laboratory.The report came on the eve of a meeting of 
                                the World Health Organization's decision-making body, which is expected to discuss
                                the next phase of an investigation into the origins of COVID-19.</p>

                            <p align="justify">The “deadly and highly infectious” nature of the second wave of COVID-19 and “unpreparedness” of the national capital’s health infrastructure forced citizens to visit hospitals in neighbouring states, the Delhi High Court said and rejected the Delhi government’s argument that such patients should seek medical relief from the state where they are getting treatment.

                                “This submission of respondent 1 (Delhi government) has been noted only to be rejected…. It is a matter of public knowledge that the deadly, highly infectious nature of the second wave of COVID-19 and the unpreparedness of the health infrastructure in the city had compelled many desperate citizens of the NCT of Delhi, like the petitioner’s father, to seek admission/medical attention at hospitals in the neighbouring states,” Justice Rekha Palli said. The observation by the high court came during hearing of a Delhi citizen’s plea seeking Liposomal Amphotericin B Injection /Amphonex-50, used in treatment of black fungus, for his father who is admitted in a hospital in Gurugram.

                                The Delhi government, during the hearing, told the court that since the petitioner’s father was not being treated in a hospital in the national capital, he should seek the medicine from the authorities concerned in Haryana.
                                
                                Rejecting the contention of the Delhi government, the court said that in the instant case the petitioner’s father was being treated for COVID-19 for over a month and since the medicine he was seeking would determine recovery of the patient, “there is definite urgency in the matter”.</p>

                                The female patient was hospitalised two weeks ago and was on a ventilator due to pneumonia. Her relatives were not allowed to see her due to Covid treatment protocols.
                                
                                By May 17, the patient’s condition was worsening and her organs had started to shut down. It was decided that she would be taken off ventilator support as there was very little that the doctors could do at that point. Her family was also informed about the same.</p>

                                Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had first imposed a lockdown on April 19 which was later extended multiple times, lastly on May 16. In the last 24 hours, around 2,200 cases were reported in the city and the positivity rate too declined to 3.5 per cent, Kejriwal said in an online briefing earlier in the day.

                                “But this does not mean the threat of coronavirus has been averted. We have to take all the steps to safeguard against coronavirus,” he said.
                                
                                The chief minister had said on Friday that he would have a discussion with the Lt governor and share the decision taken in the meeting, when asked by reporters about any relaxation in lockdown in view of the improving situation.</p>

                        <p align="justify">It is easy to feel poweCORONAWARENESS is a small initiative to help people get information
                            regarding beds, oxygen, food, plasma, etc. We only compile information that the government
                            provides or is already available in the public domain, including the internet (social
                            media). We are neither Covid healthcare service providers nor do we hoard any medicines.</p>
