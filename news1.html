                                unlikely if the second dose of a different COVID-19 vaccine is administered, but reaching a firm opinion on this will 
                                need more scrutiny and understanding, the Centre said on Thursday.

It, however, clarified that both doses administered to an individual should be of the same vaccine as per the existing protocol.

                            <p align="justify">Moderna is expecting to launch a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine in India next year and is in talks with Cipla among
                                other Indian firms, while another US giant Pfizer is ready to offer 5 crore shots in 2021 itself but it wants significant regulatory
                                relaxations including indemnification, sources said on Tuesday. While Moderna has conveyed to Indian authorities that it does not have
                                surplus vaccines to share in 2021, there are limited prospects of Johnson & Johnson exporting its jabs from the US to other countries 
                                in the near future, the sources privy to discussions added. Two rounds of high-level meetings chaired by the Cabinet Secretary were held
                                last week on the availability of vaccines in the global as well as domestic markets as it was felt that there is an urgent need to procure
                                the jabs at a time the country is reeling under an unprecedented second wave of COVID-19 and a widening gap between supply and requirement.
                                Currently, the country is using two 'made-in India' jabs -- Covishield and Covaxin -- to inoculate its billion-plus population and has administered 20
                                crore doses since launching the world's largest vaccination drive in mid-January. A third vaccine, Russian-made Sputnik V, has been approved by the
                                government and is being used on a smaller scale at present. In the high-level meeting officials from the Ministry of External Affairs, NITI Aayog,
                                Department of Biotechnology, Law Ministry and Health Ministry were present. </p>

                        <p align="justify">It is easy to feel poweCORONAWARENESS is a small initiative to help people get information
                            regarding beds, oxygen, food, plasma, etc. We only compile information that the government
                            provides or is already available in the public domain, including the internet (social
                            media). We are neither Covid healthcare service providers nor do we hoard any medicines.</p>
