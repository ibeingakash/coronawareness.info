                            </a></h3>
                            <!--news-->
                            <p align="justify">The “deadly and highly infectious” nature of the second wave of COVID-19 and “unpreparedness” of the national capital’s health infrastructure forced citizens to visit hospitals in neighbouring states, the Delhi High Court said and rejected the Delhi government’s argument that such patients should seek medical relief from the state where they are getting treatment.

                                “This submission of respondent 1 (Delhi government) has been noted only to be rejected…. It is a matter of public knowledge that the deadly, highly infectious nature of the second wave of COVID-19 and the unpreparedness of the health infrastructure in the city had compelled many desperate citizens of the NCT of Delhi, like the petitioner’s father, to seek admission/medical attention at hospitals in the neighbouring states,” Justice Rekha Palli said. The observation by the high court came during hearing of a Delhi citizen’s plea seeking Liposomal Amphotericin B Injection /Amphonex-50, used in treatment of black fungus, for his father who is admitted in a hospital in Gurugram.

                                The Delhi government, during the hearing, told the court that since the petitioner’s father was not being treated in a hospital in the national capital, he should seek the medicine from the authorities concerned in Haryana.
                                
                                Rejecting the contention of the Delhi government, the court said that in the instant case the petitioner’s father was being treated for COVID-19 for over a month and since the medicine he was seeking would determine recovery of the patient, “there is definite urgency in the matter”.</p>

                            <p align="justify">In what may be symbolic of humanity triumphing over the petty considerations that divide us, a Kerala doctor's act of goodwill is winning plaudits from all corners. The reason? Dr Rekha Krishnan, who works at a private hospital in Palakkad, recited Islamic prayers to a Muslim patient who was sinking due to Covid-19-related complications.

                                The female patient was hospitalised two weeks ago and was on a ventilator due to pneumonia. Her relatives were not allowed to see her due to Covid treatment protocols.
                                
                                By May 17, the patient’s condition was worsening and her organs had started to shut down. It was decided that she would be taken off ventilator support as there was very little that the doctors could do at that point. Her family was also informed about the same.</p>

                            <p align="justify">The Delhi government is likely to extend the ongoing lockdown by another week, although the Covid situation is improving in the city with less number of cases and declining positivity rate in the past few days, official sources said on Saturday.

                                Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had first imposed a lockdown on April 19 which was later extended multiple times, lastly on May 16. In the last 24 hours, around 2,200 cases were reported in the city and the positivity rate too declined to 3.5 per cent, Kejriwal said in an online briefing earlier in the day.

                                “But this does not mean the threat of coronavirus has been averted. We have to take all the steps to safeguard against coronavirus,” he said.
                                
                                The chief minister had said on Friday that he would have a discussion with the Lt governor and share the decision taken in the meeting, when asked by reporters about any relaxation in lockdown in view of the improving situation.</p>

So far, 64 people have been infected with black fungus in the state and of them, four have died. Black fungus or mucormycosis has been declared a notifiable disease for its co-ordinated treatment as a growing number of people are contracting the infection post COVID-19, Health Secretary Pankaj Kumar Pandey said. The state government also issued an SOP on Saturday for the judicious distribution of Amphotericin B, a drug used in treating black fungus patients. Amphotericin B should be provided to only government medical colleges, institutions and Covid-dedicated hospitals on payment after they formally requisition for its supply on the prescribed format giving details of the patients and nature of infection.

As of now, as per WHO guidelines and guidelines by other countries, people with negative COVID test report is being allowed, ” he said.

                                “When we will be able to reach a consensus at the world and WHO level (on vaccine passport issue), then we will take necessary steps,? he said responding to a question on reports claiming that people who took Covaxin jabs may not be allowed to travel internationally as the WHO hasn’t included it in its list of vaccines.</p>

                        <p align="justify">It is easy to feel poweCORONAWARENESS is a small initiative to help people get information
                            regarding beds, oxygen, food, plasma, etc. We only compile information that the government
                            provides or is already available in the public domain, including the internet (social
                            media). We are neither Covid healthcare service providers nor do we hoard any medicines.</p>
