                            <p align="justify">In such a dire global crisis, both risk management and mitigation require further strengthening of global partnerships to rekindle interest and investment in global public health. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, whose tenure as the WHO Executive Board chairperson ended on Wednesday, called for ensuring affordable access to key drugs during crises like the coronavirus pandemic and advocated a shared and collaborative response to conquer future health challenges.

Vardhan addressed the 149th Session of the WHO Executive Board on the last day of his tenure through video conference, and reminded the members of the sacrifices of “brave, distinguished and honourable” Covid warriors across the world so that humanity may survive.</p>

Apart from SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 infection, some other categories of coronaviruses also exist that people are exposed to. The other types of virus cause less severe problems like the common cold. With the great exposure to SARS-CoV-2 these days, researchers are now studying if any exposure to other coronaviruses can impact the immune system against Covid-19. According to a study published in Nature Communications, researchers have investigated cold-causing coronavirus’ impact on the immune system and if that can impact the immune system response to Covid-19.

The results showed the discovery of one cross-reactive coronavirus antibody that is triggered when a person is infected with Covid-19. Some tests conducted in the later stages also indicated that the antibody has the ability to neutralise SARS-CoV-1 which causes SARS. The researchers highlighted that this kind of cross-reactive antibody is expected to be produced by memory B cells. These cells are considered to be exposed to a coronavirus that leads to common cold. When the person is again affected with Covid-19, the cells “remember” initial disease threats.</p>

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said only B.1.617.2, one of the three strains of the B.1.617 COVID-19 variant first detected in India, is a ”variant of concern” now and noted that lower rates of transmission have been observed for the other two lineages. The B.1.617 variant was first detected in India and was divided in three lineages – B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3.

In the COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update published on Tuesday, WHO said available findings for lineages B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 were initially used to designate B.1.617 a global Variant of Concern (VOC) on May 11 this year. ”Since then, it has become evident that greater public health risks are currently associated with B.1.617.2, while lower rates of transmission of other lineages have been observed,” WHO said. The UN health agency said that in order to reflect this updated information, B.1.617 has been ”delineated”.</p>

                                anywhere between 4-12 weeks after the patient has recovered from the disease. Many Coronavirus patients who have recovered from Coronavirus during the second wave are complaining of weakness, mild fever, body ache and even breathlessness despite them testing negative for the virus. Those who had contracted the virus are feeling even more vulnerable for the fact that they cannot even get their Covid-19 vaccine shot at least 6-8 weeks after their recovery. Health experts and doctors have termed this phenomenon Long Covid.

How long can one feel after effects of Coronavirus?
According to an Indian Express report, doctors and health experts have maintained that such post Covid-19 ailments can last anywhere between 4-12 weeks after the patient has recovered from the disease. With fear of Coronavirus all around, such patients tend to assume that they have got the virus again. Apart from body rest and healthy diet, recently recovered patients should also remain in touch with their physicians.

                                Moreover, since it is an invasive technique, it is a bit uncomfortable for patients. The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has developed a simple and fast method of swab collection and processing for RT-PCR coronavirus test which could be used in rural and tribal areas.

The method is simple, fast, cost-effective, patient-friendly and comfortable, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) said.
