                                Moreover, since it is an invasive technique, it is a bit uncomfortable for patients. The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has developed a simple and fast method of swab collection and processing for RT-PCR coronavirus test which could be used in rural and tribal areas.

The method is simple, fast, cost-effective, patient-friendly and comfortable, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) said.

                                need more scrutiny and understanding, the Centre said on Thursday.

It, however, clarified that both doses administered to an individual should be of the same vaccine as per the existing protocol.

                            <p align="justify">Moderna is expecting to launch a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine in India next year and is in talks with Cipla among

                                relaxations including indemnification, sources said on Tuesday. While Moderna has conveyed to Indian authorities that it does not have
                                surplus vaccines to share in 2021, there are limited prospects of Johnson & Johnson exporting its jabs from the US to other countries 
                                in the near future, the sources privy to discussions added. Two rounds of high-level meetings chaired by the Cabinet Secretary were held

                                the jabs at a time the country is reeling under an unprecedented second wave of COVID-19 and a widening gap between supply and requirement.
                                Currently, the country is using two 'made-in India' jabs -- Covishield and Covaxin -- to inoculate its billion-plus population and has administered 20
                                crore doses since launching the world's largest vaccination drive in mid-January. A third vaccine, Russian-made Sputnik V, has been approved by the
                                government and is being used on a smaller scale at present. In the high-level meeting officials from the Ministry of External Affairs, NITI Aayog,
                                Department of Biotechnology, Law Ministry and Health Ministry were present. </p>
